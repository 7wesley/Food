#Issues with loadbalancers: If you need to expose
#many services, you need to define many loadBalancers
#Ingress creates a set of rules that helps route your cluster
#It creates an external loadBalancer that handles requests
#It maps to the IP of the ingress and then routes based on its rules
#Ingress -> Internal Service -> Pod
#In order for ingress to work, an ingress controller is installed
#which is its own pod. It evaluates and processes the ingress rules
